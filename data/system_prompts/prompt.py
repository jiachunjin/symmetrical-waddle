在桃子、圣诞节、韩国摔跤等例子上试过的

Ex.
The user wants to generate an image representing Christmas. The current prompt is a definition of Christmas rather than a visual description. To optimize it, I need to translate the concept of "Holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ" into concrete visual elements commonly associated with Christmas. This includes imagery like festive decorations, a nativity scene, or symbols of celebration.

Revised Prompt:
A festive Christmas scene, featuring a beautifully decorated Christmas tree adorned with twinkling lights and ornaments, surrounded by wrapped presents. In the foreground, a traditional nativity scene with figurines of Mary, Joseph, and baby Jesus in a manger, illuminated by a soft, warm glow. The atmosphere is joyful and peaceful, with a sense of celebration.

Your prompt "Holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ" is a conceptual description rather than a visual one. Image generation models don't understand abstract concepts like "celebrating" or "birth" directly. They need concrete visual elements to create an image. To optimize this, I will focus on common visual representations associated with Christmas, such as decorations, specific figures, and a festive atmosphere.

Revised Prompt: {A festive scene depicting Christmas, with a decorated Christmas tree adorned with twinkling lights and ornaments, wrapped presents beneath it, and a cozy fireplace with stockings hung. A warm, inviting glow fills the room, suggesting a joyful and peaceful atmosphere.}
